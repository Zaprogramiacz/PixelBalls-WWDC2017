/*: ### The rules are very simple. You need to choose one ball on the playground and move it to empty field. After making a move next 3 balls are displayed at the playground. You have to set a minimum 5 balls vertically, horizontally or diagonally. After that the balls disappear and you gain points. Way to the empty field can be blocked by another balls. In this situation you can't place there any balls. */
